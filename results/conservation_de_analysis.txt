EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis examined whether D/E (aspartate/glutamate) positions in RNA-binding
domains (RBDs) show evolutionary conservation consistent with functional importance.
If D/E-rich regions serve autoinhibitory roles, we expect:
  1. D/E positions to be at least as conserved as non-D/E positions
  2. D/E character (any D or E) to be maintained even when exact identity varies
  3. D/E segment boundaries to show positional conservation

KEY FINDINGS:

1. D/E IDENTITY vs NON-D/E IDENTITY:
   - RRM_1: D/E positions are +8.1% MORE conserved than non-D/E (0.500 vs 0.419)
   - LSM:   D/E positions are +15.7% MORE conserved than non-D/E (0.581 vs 0.424)
   - DEAD:  D/E positions are +6.0% MORE conserved than non-D/E (0.456 vs 0.395)
   - KH_1:  D/E positions are -8.9% LESS conserved than non-D/E (0.277 vs 0.366)
   - S1:    D/E positions are -8.2% LESS conserved than non-D/E (0.215 vs 0.297)

2. D/E CHARACTER CONSERVATION (D or E at position):
   - RRM_1: 62.0% of D/E positions maintain D/E character across species
   - LSM:   67.5% of D/E positions maintain D/E character across species  
   - DEAD:  56.7% of D/E positions maintain D/E character across species
   - KH_1:  45.9% of D/E positions maintain D/E character across species
   - S1:    33.8% of D/E positions maintain D/E character across species

3. D/E SEGMENT CONSERVATION:
   - D/E segments (>=3 consecutive D/E) show moderate conservation
   - Example: LSM DDE segment shows 70.6% D/E conservation
   - Example: DEAD EDEE segment shows 91.7% D/E conservation
   - Segment boundaries show variable conservation (not strongly constrained)

INTERPRETATION:
The mixed results suggest D/E positions are functionally important in SOME but not
all RBD families. RRM_1, LSM, and DEAD domains show evidence of D/E conservation
consistent with functional roles. KH_1 and S1 domains show weaker D/E conservation,
suggesting D/E residues may be less functionally constrained in these families.

The high D/E->D/E conservation (maintaining acidic character) in RRM_1, LSM, and
DEAD domains supports the hypothesis that negative charge is functionally important
at these positions, even when exact amino acid identity varies.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. D/E positions show HIGHER conservation than non-D/E positions in 3 of 5 
   RBD families analyzed (RRM_1, LSM, DEAD), supporting functional importance.

2. The "D/E character" (maintaining acidic residue) is moderately to highly
   conserved (45-68%), suggesting the negative charge rather than exact
   amino acid identity may be the key functional feature.

3. D/E segments (>=3 consecutive D/E) are found in high-D/E RBDs and show
   variable but often substantial conservation, consistent with functional
   roles for polyacidic stretches.

4. The pattern of D/E conservation is family-specific:
   - LSM: Strongest D/E conservation (+15.7%), high D/E->D/E (67.5%)
   - RRM_1: Good D/E conservation (+8.1%), high D/E->D/E (62.0%)
   - DEAD: Moderate D/E conservation (+6.0%), moderate D/E->D/E (56.7%)
   - KH_1/S1: Weaker D/E conservation, suggesting different selective pressures

5. These results are CONSISTENT with D/E regions having functional roles
   (possibly autoinhibitory) in LSM, RRM_1, and DEAD domain families, but
   the evidence is not as strong for KH_1 and S1 families.

CAVEATS:
- Analysis used a representative sample (top 15 high-D/E domains per family)
- Ortholog identification may miss some true orthologs
- Conservation patterns could reflect structural rather than regulatory functions
