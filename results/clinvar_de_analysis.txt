KEY INSIGHTS:
- E→Q (amidation): 28.3% pathogenic - HIGHEST RATE for common substitutions
- D→H: 19.4% pathogenic - charge reversal to histidine
- D→N (amidation): 18.7% pathogenic - removes charge, maintains size
- D→G, E→G: LOW pathogenicity (3.9%, 5.0%) - glycine flexibility may compensate

================================================================================
5. IN-DOMAIN VS OUT-OF-DOMAIN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

D/E removal pathogenicity by location:

  In RNA-binding domain:     17/153 = 11.1%
  Outside domain:            53/378 = 14.0%

INTERPRETATION:
Interestingly, D/E removal OUTSIDE domains shows higher pathogenicity.
This could indicate:
1. D/E residues in linker/regulatory regions have important autoinhibitory roles
2. Domain D/E residues may be more tolerant (redundancy in domain function)
3. The autoinhibition hypothesis applies more to non-domain regions

7. CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:

1. D/E REMOVAL IS PATHOGENIC (supports hypothesis)
   - D/E removal mutations: 13.2% pathogenic vs 9.8% overall (1.35x enriched)
   - Statistical significance: p = 0.007 (Fisher's exact test)
   
2. AMIDATION MUTATIONS ARE HIGHLY PATHOGENIC
   - E→Q: 28.3% pathogenic (highest common substitution)
   - D→N: 18.7% pathogenic
   - Combined: 22.3% pathogenic (2.3x enriched, p = 3.2e-05)
   - These preserve size but remove negative charge
   
3. CHARGE MATTERS MORE THAN SIZE
   - Amidation (same size, no charge): ~22% pathogenic
   - Glycine substitution (smaller, no charge): ~5% pathogenic
   - Suggests the negative charge specifically is functional
   
4. LOCATION PARADOX
   - D/E removal outside domains: 14.0% pathogenic
   - D/E removal inside domains: 11.1% pathogenic
   - Suggests autoinhibitory function may be in linker/regulatory regions
   
5. E vs D
   - E→X slightly more pathogenic than D→X (14.1% vs 12.1%)
   - E→Q more pathogenic than D→N (28.3% vs 18.7%)
   - Glutamate (longer side chain) removal may be more disruptive

INTERPRETATION FOR AUTOINHIBITION HYPOTHESIS:

The data PARTIALLY SUPPORTS the autoinhibition hypothesis:

✓ SUPPORTS:
- D/E removal is enriched for pathogenicity
- Amidation mutations (pure charge removal) are highly pathogenic
- The charge itself appears critical (not just size)

? NUANCES:
- Higher pathogenicity outside domains suggests regulatory regions matter
- E→Q being most pathogenic suggests glutamate in particular plays key roles
- Many D/E mutations are still benign (only 13% pathogenic)

LIMITATIONS:
- UniProt variants may have ascertainment bias (focus on known disease genes)
- "Pathogenic" annotation quality varies
- Cannot distinguish loss-of-function from gain-of-function mechanisms
- Need structural analysis to identify autoinhibitory D/E clusters
