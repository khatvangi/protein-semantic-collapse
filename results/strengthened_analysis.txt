STRENGTHENED HYPOTHESIS ANALYSIS
======================================================================

1. D/E SEGMENT DETECTION (corrected)
   ≥3 consecutive D/E: RBD 6.7%
   ≥5 consecutive D/E: RBD 0.1%
   ≥10 consecutive D/E: RBD 0.0%

2. PTM MULTIPLE TESTING
   Phosphorylation near D/E: raw p=0.034, Bonferroni p=0.10

3. STRUCTURAL VALIDATION
   D/E regions 12-18 Å from RNA binding site
   Contact same K/R residues as RNA

4. KNOWN CASES
   Hfq: 10-fold increase when tail removed
   FBF-2: 3-fold decrease when tail removed
   SLBP: 27-fold increase upon phosphorylation
