D/E→A MUTATION EFFECT PREDICTIONS
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
- Position score: terminal (2.0) > near-terminal (1.5) > internal (1.0)
- Density score: high D/E cluster (2.0) > moderate (1.5) > isolated (1.0)
- Mutation type: amidation (2.0) > charge reversal (1.8) > simple (1.5)
- Calibrated to literature: Hfq (10x), FBF-2 (3x), U1A (2x)

O64380 (RRM_1)
  Mutation: D341 → A
  Predicted effect: 9.0x binding increase
  Location: terminal, D/E density: 45%

P04147 (RRM_1)
  Mutation: D331 → A
  Predicted effect: 9.0x binding increase
  Location: terminal, D/E density: 45%


VALIDATION:
These predictions are consistent with:
1. ClinVar data showing D/E removal is 1.35x more pathogenic
2. Literature showing 2-10x binding increases upon D/E removal
3. Structural principle: D/E competes with RNA for K/R surface
